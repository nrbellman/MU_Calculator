# MU Calculator
***MU_Calculator*** is a simple calculator built with Python 3 and designed using the Tkinter GUI framework.

***MU_Calculator*** is the result of a group project for the Programmng Langauges (CSCI-330) course at *Millersville University of Pennsylvania*. The objectives of the project are to:

  1.  Design a solution at various levels to evaluate an expression passed in as a string in a programming langauge of your choice. (In this case Python 3)
  2. Apply the theory of Lexical Analysis (Scanning) to tokenize a string into lexemes representative of operands (numbers) or operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation)
  3. Apply the theory of Parsing to convert a stream of tokens into an Abtract Syntax Tree representative of an arithmetic expression considering operator precedence and associativity.
  4. Evaluate an Abstract Syntax Tree representation of an arithmeic expression to compute the answer.

The full specification for the project can be found [here.](https://cs.millersville.edu/~wkillian/archive/2020/fall/csci330/resources/files/project-handout.pdf)

## How to launch:
- Download the zip file `MU_Calc.zip` and unzip it in the folder / directory of your choice.
- Ensure your computer has at least Python 3.7.4 installed on it.
- In your command line terminal, navigate to the `MU_Calculator` directory.
- In the MU_Calculator directory, run the command `python MU_Calc.py` and hit `[ Enter ]` or `[ Return ]` on your keyboard.

## How to use:
- Input can be entered into the calculator via keyboard or by clicking the buttons in the GUI.
### Keybindings (Mathematical):
- Numbers -> `[ 0 ]` - `[ 9 ]`
- pi -> `[ p ]`
- e -> `[ e ]`
- Addition ( + ) -> `[ Shift ]`+`[ = ]` 
- Subtraction ( - ) -> `[ - ]`
- Multiplication ( * ) -> `[ Shift ]`+`[ 8 ]` OR `[NumPad * ]`
- Division ( / )-> `[ / ]`
- Exponentiation ( ^ ) -> `[ Shift ]`+`[ 6 ]`
- Decimal Point -> `[ . ]`
- Left Paren -> `[ Shift ]`+`[ 9 ]` 
- Right Paren -> `[ Shift ]`+`[ 0 ]`
### Keybindings (Functional):
